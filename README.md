# :blossom: Pookalam Finder :blossom:
### Team: _Tirang_
This is an automatic pookalam generator based on the relative amount of flower present with us.
The project is done using Django.

**IDEA**
<br>
Onampookalam is an essential part of the beauty of Onam. Its vibrant colours bring the joy to the festivity. But it is never easy to find the right Pookalam with the flowers available  around our locality. We find it difficult to make designs with the limited flowers we have. Thus came the idea of pookalam finder which finds you the perfect designs.
<br>

<br>
  
**How It Works**
<br>
  
The user is required to select the colours based on availability in the decreasing order. This leads to a selection from the database which is in the same order as inputted. An image which is most suitable will be displayed.
<br>
  <br>
  
**Example**
<br>
  
Suppose the user inputs red :red_circle: > yellow :yellow_circle: > white :white_circle: > orange :orange_circle: > green :green_circle: <br>
Corresponding to this an image like the below is the best result:

**FUTURE PLANS**
<br>
  
We plan to integrate Machine Learning concepts to identify the images from the web and detect the colours on it automatically. The users can also upload their pookalam designs :raised_hands: making it more fun. We can also incoporate finding the right flowers for the colours too!
