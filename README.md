This is an automatic pookalam generator based on the colour of the flowers inputted by the user. The project is done using Django. 

IDEA
During ONAM, in most of our homes, we make pookalams with the available flowers around our locality. We find it difficult to make designs with the limited flowers we have. And hence this idea of pookalam generator which generates designs based on the colours we have in hand.

How It Works
The user is required to select the colours based on availability in the decreasing order. This leads to a selection from the database which is in the same order as inputted. Thus an image which is most suitable will be displayed.

Eg. Suppose the user inputs red>yellow>white>orange>green

FUTURE PLANS
We are planning to integrate ML to create the database and predict the output automatically.
